GeoArena "temp title"

in this game the player has to
    - capture a % of squares in a grid
        - to capture a square the player must target a square and hold a button until the process ends
        - capture time can be improved with power ups
        - captured squares can reveal an item which can be collected right away or kept in the spot for future use
    - survive waves of enemies
    - get stronger with powerups either by capturing squares (hidden loot) or killing monsters (dropped loot)

game loop:
    1) game is divided in levels
    2) to complete a level a certain number of cells must be captured (60-70%?)
    3) to get to the next level a gate must be found

    level:
    - a level is chosen from a set (different layouts)
    - each level has a fixed elements:
        - cells layout:
            - monster spawn points which spawn monsters continuously in waves and give special loot at the end of the wave:
                - R => reveal cells in a radius
                - key_icon => a door to instantly go to the next level
                - weapon type => new type of shooting pattern
                - other stuff
        - location of capturable cells
        - other fixed elements (heal zones, fixed and weak defense turrets?)
    - each level has different random elements:
        - each capturable cell contain randomized loot
    - the final objective is activated when the captured percentage threshold is reached:
        - survive: survive the final wave
        - boss: kill the boss
        - search: find the key (randomly generated in a non captured cell after the objective is activated)
        - conquer: reach 90% captured
     - each final objective can be guessed either by:
        - the kind of monsters spawned
        - the level decorations
        - the level "biome"
    - the gate to the next level is revealed when the final objective is achieved

    enemy:
        - has different emotions:
            - calm (do nothing)
            - bored (find something to do)
            - alerted (investigate)
            - angry (attack the player)
            - confused (randomly chooses an emotion)
        - can spawn with different modules:
            - capture
            - movement
            - shooting

            - normal
            - elite
        - has a fixed home position where it spawns from and goes back to when not aggressive
        - can have different behaviors:
            - passive:
                - base behavior: permanent confused emotion
                - C: captures random cells
                - M: moves to random cells within its home
                - S: shoots randomly
            - neutral:
                - base behavior: calm, bored (gets angry if attacked)
                - C: doesn't capture cells
                - M: moves to random cells within its home
                - S: shoots if angry
            - protective:
